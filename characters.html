                    <p>Tom Holland has grown on me, I have been able to accept the fact that new current Spider-Man. I feel like anyone can be under the mask aslong as they do the right thing.</p></div>

                <div class="desc">Doctor Strange
                    <p>I just admire Doctor Strange for becoming a whole different person and being so determined. His powers literally keep reality safe. Especially that another movie is coming out just proves how good he fits the character.</p>

                    <p>He is the first avenger. He was a symbol for hope during tuff times. He was willing to sacrifice himself for the better of the world.</p>

                <div class="desc">Iron Man
                    <p>Iron Man is the man. He is rich. Smart. I admire him for the fact that his charcter kept developing and adapting throughout the MCU. He really wanted to keep everyone safe. He even was the one to sacrifice himself for half the universe.</p>
