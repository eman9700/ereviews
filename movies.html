            <p>The Best-Reviewed Marvel Movies, According to Me </p>
            <p>In recent years we have seen many films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) breaking records and they can carry that praise from critics.  </p>
            <p>Here you will find the best movies in my opinion.</p>

        <h1>Top 7 MARVEL MOVIES</h1>
        <h2>I have to admit ranking only 7 marvel movies is pretty hard. The simple fact is that I enjoy every single one no matter what the world says. They are all good to me. But if I were to choose well here it goes. </h2>
        <h2>Number 7: Spider-man 2</h2>
        <img src="sm2.jpg" alt="Spider-Man 2" class="seven">
            <p>I know I know. This is wasn't really part of the actual MCU but c'mon <i>NOSTALGIA.</i>I personally would say that the whole trilogy is pretty tied but out of all of them this one, oh man, is the one that stands out the most.</p>
        <h2>Number 6: Avengers Age of Ultron</h2>
        <img src="avengersaou.jpg" alt="Avengers Age of Ultron" class="seven">
            <p>I think this should be up here just the simple fact that it shows a bit of weakness in our heroes. They were really put to the test fighting against Tony's own creation. But then introding a lot of important charcters that are still seen to this day.</p>
        <h2>Number 5: Doctor Strange</h2>
        <img src="doctorstrange.jpg" alt="Doctor Strange" class="seven">
            <p>He is the sourcer supreme. Like he is literal magic. He is so powerful that I can't even put it into words. And Benedict just fits the character so perfectly.</p>
        <h2>Number 4: Shange Chi</h2>
        <img src="shangchi.jpg" alt="Shang Chi" class="seven">
            <p>I reallt enjoyed this movies because I like anime and I feel like they kind of incorporated it because anime is so big right now. They executed it very well and it brought more diversity into the MCU.</p>
        <h2>Number 3: Black Panther</h2>
        <img src="blackpanther.jpg" alt="Black Panther" class="seven">
            <p>My respects to Chadwick. BE played the Black Panther very well and I just can't see myself seeing another actor taking his place. I know they were films coming out for his character and a lot of things had to change throughout the MCU just because of what occurred. </p>
        <h2>Number 2: Avengers Endgame</h2>
        <img src="endgame.jpg" alt="Avengers Endgame" class="seven">
            <p>Endgame has to be up here it literally broke records. It brought so much excitement. I was literally crying and yelling and all kinds of stuff when I was at the theatre. Best movie ever.</p>
        <h2>Number 1: Spider-man No Way Home</h2>
        <img src="nowayhome.jpg" alt="Spider-man No Way Home" class="seven">
            <p>Yes, this is my number 1. I liked it but I kind of expected more. I mainly just loved the fact that productions heard the voices of the fans and integrated all 3 actors that have played Spider-Man.</p>
